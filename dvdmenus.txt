SMPlayer 0.6.7 adds the possibility to display DVD menus.

In order to enable DVDNAV support, you need:

* to "Enable DVD menus" in Preferences->Drives
* a recent MPlayer (version?) build with dvdnav support is required

Note:
* MPV does not support DVDNAV
* when switching title, the library handling DVD navigation prints the VTS
  (Video Track Set) number of the currently playing title. SMPlayer needs the
  title number of the currently playing title. It will try to deduce the title
  number from the VTS number based on duration, number of tracks and history,
  but may fail to do so if multiple tracks have the same duration and the DVD
  contains a video track set with multiple titles.
* the MPlayer cache will be DISABLED, DVD menus won't work with it. This can
  affect performance.
* if the audio track is changed, when you return to the DVD menu the
  sound may be lost (while printing a lot of error messages "Too many
  video packets in the buffer").
* subtitles may disappear after seeking.
