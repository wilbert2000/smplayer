    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WZPlayer is a graphical user interface for MPV and MPlayer based on
    SMPlayer, http://www.smplayer.info. It offers menus, buttons and controls to
    conveniently play the media supported by MPV and MPlayer.

    WZPlayer uses Qt (https://www.qt.io) for its user interface, promising to
    run on any platform supported by Qt. It has only been properly tested on
    Linux, so, unless you have a special interest in WZPlayer, it is probably
    Linux only.

    To build and install WZPlayer please read Install.txt.
