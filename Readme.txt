    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    WZPlayer is a graphical user interface for MPV and MPlayer based upon
    SMPlayer, http://www.smplayer.info, by Ricardo Villalba.

    The most notable differences are improved performance, better and faster
    scaling, better DVDNAV support, no working skins yet, no setup needed,
    lots of setup available, no support and lots of source...

    To compile and install WZPlayer please read Install.txt.
