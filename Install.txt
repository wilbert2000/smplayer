This document explains how to build and install wzplayer.

1) Build
2) Install
3) Build on Windows

Note: WZPlayer should build and run on Windows, but lacks extensive testing on
Windows. Unless you have a special interest in WZPlayer you are probably better
of with a Windows specific media player. If you want to try it anyway, see
"3) Build on Windows" for guidelines.


1) Build
--------------
Be sure you have installed the Qt 4.6 or higher development packages. Its name
maybe qt4-devel, libqt4-dev, the higher the version the better.

From a shell, issue the following command inside the directory under which you
want to install the WZPlayer source:

git clone 'https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git' wzplayer

This will checkout the WZPlayer source into the subdirectory wzplayer.
To build the source:

cd wzplayer
make


2) Install
--------------
If the build succeeded, you can install WZPlayer into /usr/local with:
sudo make install

By default wzplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX.

make PREFIX=/usr
sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

Will install wzplayer under /usr.

Package maintainers can have a look at create_deb.sh and create_rpm,sh.
DESTDIR can be used to override PREFIX for the final install:

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

Will build wzplayer for /usr, but will install it in /tmp/usr/


3) Build on Windows
----------------------------
You need to have git and at least Qt 4.6, but preferrable Qt 5.4 or later,
with the MinGW compiler installed. You can get git from
https://git-scm.com/downloads and Qt with MinGW from http://www.qt.io/ .

To install the WZPlayer source open a command line prompt in the directory
under which you want to install the source. The source will be installed in the
subdirectory wzplayer with the following command:
git clone "https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git" wzplayer

Open Qt Creator and open the project file wzplayer/src/wzplayer.pro.
Qt Creator will offer you to configure the project.
Select "Configure project".
You can now build, run and modify WZPlayer.
