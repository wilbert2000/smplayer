This document explains how to compile and install wzplayer.

1) Compilation general
2) Changing the installation path
3) Compiling under Windows
4) How to create a deb package
5) How to create a rpm package

1) Compilation general
----------------------
For Windows see "Compiling under Windows"

Be sure you have installed the Qt 4.4 or higher development packages. Its name
maybe qt4-devel, libqt4-dev, the higher the version the better. Issue the
following commands from the directory under which you want to install the
source:

git clone 'https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git' wzplayer
cd wzplayer
make

If building succeeded you can install WZPlayer into /usr/local with:
sudo make install


2) Changing the installation path
-----------------------------
By default wzplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX.

make PREFIX=/usr
sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

Would install wzplayer under /usr.

DESTDIR can be useful for package maintainers.

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

Will build wzplayer for /usr and install it in /tmp/usr/

3) Compiling under Windows
----------------------------
You need to have git and at least Qt 4.4, but preferrable Qt 5.4 or later, with
the MinGW compiler installed. You can get git from
https://git-scm.com/downloads and Qt with MinGW from http://www.qt.io/.

To install the WZPlayer source open a command line prompt in the directory
under which you want to install the source. The source will be installed in the
subdirectory wzplayer with the following command:
git clone "https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git" wzplayer

Open Qt Creator and open the project file wzplayer/src/wzplayer.pro.
Qt Creator will offer you to configure the project.
Select "Configure project".
You can now build, modify and run WZPlayer.

4) How to create a deb package
----------------------------
Make sure you have installed the following packages: libqt4-dev, zlib1g-dev,
fakeroot, build-essential, devscripts, debhelper, g++ and git.

To install them:
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev zlib1g-dev fakeroot build-essential devscripts debhelper g++ git

Run ./create_deb.sh from the directory where you installed the WZPlayer sources.

5) How to create a rpm package
----------------------------

Make sure you have git installed.

Run ./create_rpm.sh

It will create a clean clone from the WZPlayer repository in the tmp directory,
so, except for the create_rpm.sh file, you don't need the source to be checked out.
It will copy the latest tar ball to the package dir and call rpmbuild to build
the package.
