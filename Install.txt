This document explains how to build and install wzplayer.

1) Build
2) Installation
3) Packages
4) Build on Windows

Note: WZPlayer runs on Windows, but it lacks extensive testing on Windows.
Unless you have a special interest in WZPlayer you are probably better
of with a Windows specific player. If you want to try it anyway,
see "4) Build on Windows" for guidelines.


1) Build
--------------
Make sure you have the Qt 5 development packages installed.
From a shell, issue the following command inside the directory under which you
want to install the WZPlayer source:

git clone 'https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git' wzplayer

This will checkout the WZPlayer source from github into the subdirectory
wzplayer.

To build the source:
cd wzplayer
make

If make is succesfull then the build subdirectory should contain the WZPlayer
executable.


2) Installation
---------------
To install WZPlayer into /usr/local:
sudo make install

By default wzplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
passing PREFIX to make.

make PREFIX=/usr
sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

Will first build and than install wzplayer under /usr.


3) Packages
---------------
To create a package have a look at create_deb.sh and create_rpm,sh.


4) Build on Windows
-------------------
You need to have git and Qt 5 with the MinGW compiler installed.
You can get git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and Qt with MinGW from
http://www.qt.io/

To get the WZPlayer source from github, open a command line prompt and cd to the
directory under which you want to install the source. The following command will
download the source from github and install it into the subdirectory wzplayer:

git clone "https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git" wzplayer

Open Qt Creator and open the project file wzplayer/src/wzplayer.pro.
Qt Creator will offer you to configure the project. Select "Configure project"
and accept the defaults or configure the project the way you like it.

You should now be able to build, run and modify WZPlayer.
