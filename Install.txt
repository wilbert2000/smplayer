This document explains how to compile and install wzplayer.

1) Compilation general
2) Changing installation path
3) Compiling under Windows
4) How to create a deb package
5) How to create a rpm package

1) Compilation general
----------------------
For Windows see "Compiling under Windows"

Be sure you have installed the Qt 4 or higher development package. Its name
maybe qt4-devel, libqt4-dev or similar. Issue the following commands in the
directory under which you want to install the source and compile wzplayer:

git clone 'https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git' wzplayer
cd wzplayer
make

If compiling succeeded you can install wzplayer with:
sudo make install
That will install wzplayer in /usr/local.


2) Changing installation path
-----------------------------
By default wzplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX.

Examples:
make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr install

That would install wzplayer under /usr.

DESTDIR can be useful for package maintainers.

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

Would compile wzplayer for /usr and install it in /tmp/usr/

3) Compiling under Windows
----------------------------
You need to have git and at least Qt 4.4 with the MinGW compiler installed.
You can get git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and Qt with MinGW from
http://www.qt.io/

To install the WZPlayer source open a command line prompt in the directory
under which you want to install the source, for example by selecting the
directory and choosing "Git bash here". The source will be installed in a
subdirectory wzplayer with the following command:
git clone "https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git" wzplayer

Open Qt Creator and open the project file wzplayer/src/wzplayer.pro.
Qt Creator will offer you the options to configure the project.
Select "Configure project".
You can now build, modify and run wzplayer.

4) How to create a deb package
----------------------------
Make sure you have installed the following packages: libqt4-dev, zlib1g-dev,
fakeroot, build-essential, devscripts, debhelper, g++ and git.

To install them:
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev zlib1g-dev fakeroot build-essential devscripts debhelper g++ git

Run ./create_deb.sh from the directory where you installed the WZPlayer sources.

5) How to create a rpm package
----------------------------

Make sure you have git installed.

Run create_rpm.sh from anywhere.

It will create a fresh clone from the WZPlayer repository to the tmp directory,
copy the tar ball to the package dir and call rpmbuild to build the package.
