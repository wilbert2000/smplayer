This document explains how to build and install wzplayer.

1) Build
2) Install
3) Build on Windows

Note: WZPlayer runs on Windows, but it lacks extensive testing on Windows.
Unless you have a special interest in WZPlayer you are probably better
of with a Windows specific media player. If you want to try it anyway,
see "3) Build on Windows" for guidelines.


1) Build
--------------
Be sure you have installed the Qt 5 development packages. From a shell, issue
the following command inside the directory under which you want to install the
source:

git clone 'https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git' wzplayer

This will checkout the WZPlayer source into the subdirectory wzplayer.
To build the source:

cd wzplayer
make


2) Install
--------------
To install WZPlayer into /usr/local:
sudo make install

By default wzplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX.

make PREFIX=/usr
sudo make PREFIX=/usr install

Will install wzplayer under /usr.

Package maintainers can have a look at create_deb.sh and create_rpm,sh.
For testing DESTDIR can be used to override PREFIX for the final install
location:

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

Will build wzplayer for /usr, but will install it in /tmp/usr/


3) Build on Windows
----------------------------
You need to have git and at least Qt 5 with the MinGW compiler installed.
You can get git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and Qt with MinGW from
http://www.qt.io/

To install the WZPlayer source open a command line prompt in the directory
under which you want to install the source. With the following command the
source will be installed in the subdirectory wzplayer:

git clone "https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git" wzplayer

Open Qt Creator and open the project file wzplayer/src/wzplayer.pro.
Qt Creator will offer you to configure the project.
Select "Configure project".

You can now build, run and modify WZPlayer.
