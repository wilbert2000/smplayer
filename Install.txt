This document explains how to compile and install wzplayer.

1) Compilation general
2) Changing installation path
3) Compiling under Windows
4) How to make a deb package

1) Compilation general
----------------------
For Windows see "Compiling under Windows"

Be sure you have installed the Qt 4 development package. Its name maybe
qt4-devel, libqt4-dev or similar. Issue the following commands in the
directory where you want to install the source and compile wzplayer:

git clone 'https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git' wzplayer
cd wzplayer
make

If compiling succeeded you can install wzplayer with "make install".
That will install wzplayer in /usr/local.


2) Changing installation path
-----------------------------
By default wzplayer will be installed in /usr/local. You can change it by
using PREFIX and DESTDIR.

Examples:
make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr install

That would install wzplayer under /usr.

DESTDIR will be useful for package maintainers.

make PREFIX=/usr
make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp/ install

That would compile wzplayer for /usr but in fact it will be installed in
/tmp/usr/

3) Compiling under Windows
----------------------------
You need to have git and and least Qt 4.4 installed. You can get Qt from
http://www.qt.io/

During the installation it will ask you for a compiler. Simply let the
Qt installer download and install MinGW.

To install the WZPlayer source issue the following command from the directory
where you want to install the source:
git clone "https://github.com/wilbert2000/wzplayer.git" wzplayer

The next step is to open the Qt console: select the option "Qt 4.x
Command Prompt" that you'll find under the Qt menu.

That'll open a new command line shell. cd to the directory where you installed
wzplayer and issue the following command:
compile_windows.bat

Compiling should start and take a while.

If everything went well you should find the new compiled wzplayer.exe in the
wzplayer\src\release directory.


4) How to make a deb package
----------------------------
Be sure you have installed the following packages: libqt4-dev, zlib1g-dev,
fakeroot, build-essential, devscripts, debhelper and g++.

sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev zlib1g-dev fakeroot build-essential devscripts debhelper g++

Now run ./create_deb.sh
